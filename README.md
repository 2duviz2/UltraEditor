# UltraEditor (W.I.P.)
UltraEditor is a mod for ULTRAKILL that adds an in-game level editor, letting users modify existing levels and create entirely new ones (or at least that's the idea)

If you're interested in a guide on how to use the mod, check the official [documentation](https://duviz.xyz/ultraeditor/docs)

This mod aims to be user-friendly, even if it means adding limitations just so casual players understand what's going on, leaving the "heavy" work for in-Unity level editors like [Vanity Reprised by EternalUnion](https://github.com/eternalUnion/VanityReprised/releases)

To-Do 📌:
* Saving system that saves every property
* More array types
* More variable types

Ideas 💡:
* In-game script compiling

Notes 🗒️:
* I'm really bad at making projects public, if you see a lot of references in the project, that's because this mod is a branch from another mod
* This editor is NOT FINISHED, that means that a lot of things are broken or don't work as intended.
* Saving is in a work in progress state, savings may break between versions! Any version that changes the letter (v0.0.0a) will mean that the saving has been changed drastically and old levels may not work.
