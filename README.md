# UltraEditor (W.I.P.)
UltraEditor is a mod for ULTRAKILL that adds an in-game level editor, letting users modify existing levels and create entirely new ones (or at least that's the idea)

This mod aims to be user-friendly, even if it means adding limitations just so casual players understand what's going on, leaving the "heavy" work for in-Unity level editors like [Vanity Reprised by EternalUnion](https://github.com/eternalUnion/VanityReprised/releases)

To-Do 📌:
* Saving system that saves every property
* More array types
* More variable types

Ideas 💡:
* In-game script compiling

Notes 🗒️:
* I'm really bad at making projects public, if you see a lot of references in the project, that's because this mod is a branch from another mod
* This editor is NOT FINISHED, that means that a lot of things are broken or won't work as intended. If you want to make a level, DO NOT USE THIS in this state
